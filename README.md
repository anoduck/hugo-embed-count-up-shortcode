## Hugo Embed Count Up Shortcode

A count up timer is the opposite of a countdown timer, instead of counting down towards an event, a count up timer counts up from an event. 
Often in the world of apps, these are referred to as "stopwatches", but this name is a misnomer. For the sake of transparency and in maintaining
a personal tradition of over lofty dialogues, this shortcode was written in a hurry due to a fast approaching tropical storm. So, it is missing 
many of the niceties that are usally expected with shortcodes. You will have to open the javascript file and set the beginning date yourself.

This module should follow the same convention of installation as other hugo modules, and is as follows:

1. Add the module to your go.mod
```
hugo mod fetch github.com/anoduck/hugo-embed-count-up-shortcode:latest
```

2. Then add the module to your config.toml or your config.yaml or your hugo.toml or your hugo.yaml etc, etc...
